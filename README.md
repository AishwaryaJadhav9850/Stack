## Stack Implementation in Python using List Data Structure
[List Stack Python Implementation](https://github.com/AishwaryaJadhav9850/Stack/blob/master/Stack.py)
- IDE - Spyder 3.2.6

- Python - 3.6

### Methods Implemented:

* Push operation on stack - push()

* Pop operation on stack - pop()  

* Print Top element of the stack - peek()

* Print whether the stack is empty - empty()

* Display Stack - display()

## PostFix Expression Evaluation Stack Implementation in Python using Deque Collections

[Postfix Expression Evaluation Code](https://github.com/AishwaryaJadhav9850/Stack/commit/25b5d6055002bb57afd3e4b995daf1cf510dca32)

- Infix expressions are not used for representation of an expression inside computers.

- Postfix and Prefix expressions are free from any precedence. They are more suited for mechanization.

- Computers use postfix form for representation of an expression

- e.g. Postfix Expression : 5 3 2 * +

- Result of this Postfix Expression be 11

## Prefix Expression Evaluation Stack Implementation in Python using Deque Collections
[Prefix Expression Evaluation Code](https://github.com/AishwaryaJadhav9850/Stack/commit/1cf67697da95e0edd6ffab425c925d289a1597c4)

- An prefix expression is evaluated by scanning it from right to left.
- An operand is pushed on top of the stack
- In case of an operator, 2 operands are popped form the stack, evaluated and pushed back onto the stack
- Final result is found on the top of the stack
- Prefix Expression : + 5 * 3 2
- Result of this Prefix Expression be 11
